In the project directory, you can run:

## How to test
*** click on the demo link above and tinker a little on the redirected to link
*** clone this repo and build manually (pwa features are available only in a development build)


## Testing the pwa features

As a pwa, this implies that this site is available and functions even when navigated to while offline. To test these features as implimented on the BeerBank,
1. head over to the demo link ( or your cloned production build served on https or from localhost)
2. tinker a little with the app. That is, search a few beers, scroll down extensibly from the beers list and when done.
3. go offline ( either by turning offline mode on in the browser devtools or switching off the internet connection) and try to replay all the steps you went through during the tinkering phase.
